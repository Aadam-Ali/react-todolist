# Title of Project

üñ•Ô∏è [Live Preview](https://todolist-react-aadam.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This is my first project with React. While it is cliche being a todolist, it allows me to showcase some of the main functionality of React. This mainly includes, hooks (useEffect, useState) and props. The application allows you to delete and mark tasks as completed and consists of a responsive design that makes the app useful on multiple devices.

## Future Plans

In the future, the main functionality that I am considering to implement is allowing for greater data persistence by storing data remotely.

## Known Bugs

As far as I am aware there are no bugs, however if you do find any don't be shy to let me know (I am open to criticism and advice)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- React
